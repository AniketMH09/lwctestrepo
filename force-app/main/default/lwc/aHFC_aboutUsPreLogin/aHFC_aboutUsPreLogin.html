                Our History
            </div>
            <div class="AHFC_CardDetail">
                AHFC began operations in 1980 by offering wholesale financing on a nationwide basis in the United States to authorized Honda motorcycle dealers. We began offering wholesale financing for Honda power equipment in 1983, followed by Honda and Acura motor
                vehicles in 1986. In 1985, AHFC started offering retail financing with pilot programs for Honda motorcycles and Honda power equipment in California and Florida and in May 1986 for Honda and Acura motor vehicles in California. In April
                1990, we began offering retail leasing for Honda and Acura motor vehicles in California. Since 1992, retail financing and retail leasing of motor vehicles have comprised the largest segment of our business.
            </div>
            <div class="AHFC_CardDetail">Today, HFS and AFS offer financing in the form of both retail installment sales contracts and automobile leases, depending on the product and the needs of each of our customers. Leases are offered through our affiliate Honda Lease Trust for
                new and used Honda and Acura motor vehicles.</div>
